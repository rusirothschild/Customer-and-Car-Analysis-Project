# Car and Customer Satisfaction Analysis

This project explores two separate datasets as part of a data science final assignment. 
Part 1 focuses on car specifications and fuel efficiency, while Part 2 examines factors influencing customer satisfaction in a call center setting.

## Problem Descriptions

**Part 1:**  
Analyze the relationship between vehicle features (e.g., weight, horsepower, cylinders) and miles per gallon (MPG), using regression models and visual analytics.

**Part 2:**  
Investigate factors that impact customer sentiment and satisfaction, including communication channel, reason for contact, and call duration.

## Tools Used

- **R** (for data wrangling, regression, plots)
- **Tableau** (for interactive visualizations)
- **Excel** (for initial feature creation and manual inspection)

## Key Findings

- Heavier cars generally have higher horsepower, but MPG decreases as weight and cylinder count increase.
- There was no strong statistical relationship between sentiment scores and call duration, reason, or response time.
- Payment issues are exclusively handled via call centers, while service outages are mostly managed via automated channels.
